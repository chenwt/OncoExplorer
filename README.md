## Connected pathway graph
* SGA sets: 559 Might use that in train datasets.
* DEG sets: 8,841 Might use that in train datasets.
* Nodes(SGA | DEG): 9,158 
* Directed edges(TDI pairs) = 1,496,128(?????)

## Raw dataset
* Directed edges(TDI pairs, same path in different patients count as different ones): 3,279,967.

Note: we do not remove the duplicated records, they account for 200/3,279,967.
We use the aggregate of SGA and DEG in advance.
