# Next steps:
* Build up different affinity metrics of SGA.
* Figure out the KEGG pathway.

* Run spectral clustering.
* Run t-SNE using scaled 8k-Dim 0/1 vector.
* Run hierarchical clustering on DEG and cluster the SGA.

Check the PI3K etc. pathway.

* Try ProPPR rule to classify.

Compare the results.

Next? Try GoTerm merge and clustering.

SGA profile -> spectral clustering
Weight
CC
positive predictive value

Go Enrichment analysis.


* What I haven't tried:

I didn't try to measure the closeness of the SGA & DEG by considering the occurrence.

I didn't try to plot the ocurrence of GENEs in a specific pathway in the figure generated by t-SNE.

* Use existing algorithm from Dr. Lu to clustering the GoTerm, and then test with our ProPPR rules.

* Compare the SGA network in different cancers.

* Continue to test with pathway, although they overlap little.


* Test with organelles structure, other than biological process.
* Consider the directions of the perturbations? (Future direction)
* (Try with the unfiltered datasets of TDI pairs)





* Check the overlap of SGA & DEG w/ KEGG pathway.

lowercase the record: tr A-Z a-z < TDI_Results_new.csv > out (Also No duplication, containing unit SGA)

It seems that the nodes do not contain each other in the relationship of 'is_a'..

* __We could use the 'is_a' relationship to cluster the DEGs. Further, we can propogate the SGA->DEG->GOTerm->subsets goterm of 8150.__

* Examine the class of SGA through GOTerm, or through DEG and then GOTerm, compare the differences.

![alt tag](https://github.com/yifengtao/OncoExplorer/blob/master/figure/fig8_rbm17.jpg)

* try different methods of clustering, e.g. using spetral clustering to check the differences between cancers.

* Test with BRCA, GBM, OV.

python analysis02.py --inputData /usr1/public/yifeng/Github/outputData --outputData /usr1/public/yifeng/Github/outputData --cancer gbm


BRCA: 480,577 pat,sga,deg records -> aggregate 22,499, 21,141 SGA edges, 529 nodes.

GBM: 151,030 -> 7,150, 3,043 SGA edges, 313 nodes.

OV: 110,125 -> 9,397, 6,251 SGA edges, 418 nodes.

It seems that merely aggregate the total number of overlap is not enough to distinguish the clusters...

![alt tag](https://github.com/yifengtao/OncoExplorer/blob/master/figure/fig2_ov_cluster1.jpg)

* try different scoring methods, e.g., Jaccard.

python analysis03.py --inputData /usr1/public/yifeng/Github/outputData --outputData /usr1/public/yifeng/Github/outputData --cancer gbm

The parameter of edges and nodes is the same with the raw methods.

It seems to be better.
![alt tag](https://github.com/yifengtao/OncoExplorer/blob/master/figure/fig3_ov_cluster2.jpg)

This can also be seen from the distribution of the (SGA,SGA) weight, which shows some edges have much larger weight, other than the noise in simple overlap version.

Simple overlap version:
![alt tag](https://github.com/yifengtao/OncoExplorer/blob/master/figure/fig7_hist_SGAweight_simple.jpg)
But may become better if we can set a threshold?
Well... Actually I am really not sure if this is better after the experiment... if merely from the figure. Might need some other source?

Remember to check duplicated edges among patients.

* Our methods is able to analyze within different types of cancers with different number of patients.

* Test within one subset:

molecular function
molecular activities of gene products
__cellular component__
where gene products are active
__biological process__
pathways and larger processes made up of the activities of multiple gene products.

* t-SNE.
It looks crazy, even if I tried to carefully tune the perplexity, the graph in 2D is hard to cluster into different classes. The example of BRCA is shown below:
![alt tag](https://github.com/yifengtao/OncoExplorer/blob/master/figure/fig9_tsne_brca.jpg)

There might be some other parameters to tune, e.g., the calculation of weight and distance.

* Also we can consider the role within through patient-wise rule.

Note that we may want to filter the GoTerm which is not related to biological process in the goAnn.cfacts file: Already filltered.

* It would be pretty interesting to check the results from three parts: simplified (SGA,SGA) weighted.

* Check with SGA->GoTerm classification.

Merely classify the SGAs based on the goTerm seems not to be consistent with the graph classification.

* Check with SGA->DEG->GoTerm classification.
It does not seem to work well...

* Throw away the new dataset, use the `Github/inputData/ensemble.txt: 1+3,281,018`
